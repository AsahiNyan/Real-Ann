# Real Ann
A theme for the [Urn speedrun spliter](https://github.com/paoloose/urn) that uses images for split backgrounds based on the splits name.

---
# Current progress
Currently `Real Ann` supports very little, and is more of a demo concept. 
However i plan on getting some of the popular speedrun games in there, and some not so popular ones too.

## What it supports
- Some General SM64 level shortenings without star count in split name (not all are included yet).
- SM64 70 star with star count in split name with one specific route.

## What is planed to be supported
- Every SM64 Run with various amounts of stars in split's names.
- Every Level in the game "Lemmings" with level names as split names.
- Some one-off things for games i personaly enjoy running or watching.
