**Note:** This is a advanced theme you are **expected** to fix issues that arent related to the css code or images itself, yourself.

Images are pulled as raw links from this Git repo over internet. Manual download of the images is not needed. This Also means that a internet connection is required for this theme to work, the reason this is done is because a local version of this theme would not be easy to achive due to the need for absolute links, and i do not want people putting a bunch of images in root, this aproach also makes maintaing images and updates easier.
